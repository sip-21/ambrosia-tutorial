# Installation

## Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+), macOS 10.15+, or Windows 10/11
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended
- **Disk Space**: 2GB free space
- **Network**: Internet connection

# Step 1: Install Docker

## For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Docker
sudo apt install curl docker.io

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Add your user to the docker group (allows running Docker without sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Refresh your user session to apply group changes
su - $USER

# Install git
sudo apt install -y docker.io curl git
```

## For macOS

1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
3. Drag Docker to your Applications folder
4. Launch Docker from Applications
5. Follow the setup wizard
6. Docker will start automatically

## For Windows

1. Download Docker Desktop for Windows from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Restart your computer when prompted
5. Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu
6. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a green icon in the system tray)

## Verify Docker Installation

After installing Docker, verify it's working correctly:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see output like:
```
Docker version 28.2.2, build 28.2.2-0ubuntu1
```

## Verify Git is Installed

```bash
git --version
```

If you see the version number, Docker and Git are installed correctly! Skip to Step 3.

# Step 2: Install Git (If Not Already Installed)

Git is needed to download the Ambrosia source code from GitHub.

## Install Git

**For macOS:**
```bash
brew install git
```
(Requires Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew, download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com))

**For Windows:**
Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

# Step 3: Clone the Ambrosia Repository

Now we'll download the Ambrosia source code from GitHub.

## Navigate to Your Preferred Directory

First, decide where you want to install Ambrosia. For example:

```bash
# Option 1: Install in your home directory
cd ~

# Option 2: Install in a specific projects folder
cd ~/projects
```

## Clone the Repository

Run the following commands to download Ambrosia:

```bash
# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/olympus-btc/ambrosia.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd ambrosia
```

## Verify the Files

Check that you're in the correct directory with the project files:

```bash
ls
```

You should see files including:
- `docker-compose.yml` (Docker configuration)
- `README.md` (Project documentation)
- Various folders like `server`, `client`, etc.

# Step 4: Build and Start the Containers

From the `ambrosia` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**This process may take 3-5 minutes on first run**, especially on slower internet connections. Subsequent starts will be much faster.

# Step 5: Set up your Phoenixd Lightning Node

## Back up your seed words
Write down your seed and put it somewhere secret/safe (**VERY IMPORTANT BEFORE PUTTING MONEY ON THE NODE**):

```
docker exec -it phoenixd cat /phoenix/.phoenix/seed.dat
```

#### Open a channel/Get inbound liquidity
By default, phoenixd will request 2Msat of inbound liquidity from the ACINQ LSP, whenever it runs out of inbound liquidity. This of course includes when you first start the node and receive your very first payment. ACINQ charges 1% of the amount of inbound liquidity requested, which is 20ksat (plus the mining fee). Since 20ksat is about US$20 at the time of writing, and since we don't need this much inbound liquidity for a workshop, we instead configure phoenixd not to request inbound liquidity.

*(Note: if you actually want 2M sats of inbound liquidity, just omit this. If you go this route, you should send ~25ksats as your first payment, most of which will be taken by ACINQ for the fee)*:

Edit the phoenixd config:
```
sudo nano "$(docker inspect -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ if eq .Destination "/phoenix" }}{{ .Source }}/.phoenix/phoenix.conf{{ end }}{{ end }}' phoenixd)"
```
Add these two lines to the config file (this should be fine as long as mining fees are lower than 5k):
```
auto-liquidity=off
max-mining-fee=5000
```

Now save and exit (ctrl+s, ctrl+x).

Restart your container to pick up the new settings:
```
docker restart phoenixd
```

Next, we deposit 5ksats into our node:
```
docker exec -it phoenixd /phoenix/bin/phoenix-cli createinvoice --amountSat=5000 --desc="initial deposit"
```
- Copy the resulting bolt11 (`lnbc...`)
- Create a QR of your bolt11:
```
qrencode -t ANSIUTF8 <lnbc....>
```
- Scan it with your lightning wallet and pay

# Step 6: Access Ambrosia

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see the Ambrosia onboarding screen

## Stopping Ambrosia

When you're done using Ambrosia, you can stop the containers:

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose stop
```
